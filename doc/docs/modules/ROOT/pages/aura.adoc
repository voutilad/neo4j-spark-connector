= Using with Neo4j Aura

[abstract]
--
This chapter describes considerations around using Neo4j Connector for Apache Spark with link:https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/[Neo4j Aura].
--

== Overview

link:https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/[Neo4j Aura] is a fully managed database as a service providing Neo4j.

== Connecting to Aura

Connecting to Neo4j Aura is similar to connecting to on-premises Neo4j, but keep in mind:

* Always use a `neo4j+s://` driver URI when communicating with the cluster in the client application.  The optimal
driver URI will be provided by Aura itself when you create a database
* In Aura Enterprise consider creating a separate username/password for Spark access; avoid running all processes through the default
`neo4j` account.

== Connecting to Aura from Spark on Databricks

Aura customers connecting from Databricks may encounter SSL handshake errors due to Databricks' custom Java security settings removing certain cipher support.

See the Aura knowledge base article link:https://aura.support.neo4j.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500003161121[Connecting to Aura with Databricks] for more information and how to configure your Databricks cluster to support connections to Aura.
